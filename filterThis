## Input : Picture as Matrix B and size of the Filter N (should be between 50 and 120).
##Output ; Picture as Matrix A, Fourier filtered.

function [A] = filterThis (B, N)

  C = fftshift(fft2(B));
  [x,y] = size(B);
  D = 1-filterOnes(x,y,N);
  D = double(D);
  A = real(ifft2(ifftshift(C.*D)));
  imshow(A, [])
  
endfunction
